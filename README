#TYPES OF COMMIT STATES

UNTRAKCED -> a file is called untracked file when it is not added to the staging area 


STAGED -> a file is called staged if it is added to the staging area by using "git add <file name>"


COMMITTED -> a file is commited if it is tracked and the changes done in it are to be stored permanently in a commit using "git commit -m "<commit message>"



#IMPORTANCE of Git history 

-> helpful in keeping a track of the changes done in the process of developing a software 

-> necessary if there is any need to change any particular commit or changes done in the past .

-> with the help of track of the history we can track the bugs and fix then in the future.
