## Types of Commit States

### a) Untracked
A file is called an untracked file when it is not added to the staging area.

### b) Staged
A file is called staged if it is added to the staging area by using `git add <file name>`, or all files at once using `git add .`.

### c) Committed
A file is committed if it is tracked and the changes done in it are stored permanently in a commit using `git commit -m "<commit message>"`.

## Importance of Git History

- Helps in keeping track of the changes made during the software development process.
- Necessary if there is a need to revert to any particular commit or changes made in the past.
- With the help of the history, we can track bugs and fix them in the future.
